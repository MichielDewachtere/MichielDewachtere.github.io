                <h2>About Dream Machine</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Dream Machine</b> takes place in the dream of our client Steven. It contains <b>5 scenes</b>, each with its own puzzle and own "dream
                    scene" as reward to that puzzle. The game contains multiple <b>interactable objects</b>, each having <b>2 states</b>, their normal state
                    and their trigger state. In every scene, one object is the trigger to start the scene; then this object does something different
                    from normal, again contributing to the <b>dream experience</b>. The player also has a <b>polaroid camera</b> equipped. The player can use this to
                    take pictures of anything, but when certain <b>distortion fields</b> are captured, the player will discover a <b>hidden riddle</b>, pointing to the
                    trigger object. The game also gives the player the option to <b>store the pictures</b> in their local Pictures folder.
                    <br>
                    Our client aims to present this visual experience at <b>art galleries</b>, where everyone interested can try. We kept this in mind, of course,
                    and adapted our game to this target audience, making the game more <b>accessible</b> using a lot of <b>player feedback</b> and <b>simple controls</b>.
                </p>
                <h3>My Contribution</h3>
                <p>
                    The team consisted of <b>2 programmers</b>, which means I was active in multiple aspects of the game.
                    <br>
                    I implemented the <b>custom player movement</b>, the different <b>interactable objects</b>, the ability to <b>shrink in the maquette</b> (see the
                    <a href="#project-gallery">gallery</a> below). All the <b>UI and HUD</b> were also implemented by me, including different <b>menus</b> (start, pause, settings, chapters, etc.)
                    and in-game UI. Finally, I also implemented the <b>polaroid mechanic</b>, which takes pictures and reveals <b>hidden text</b> when looking at the correct area.
                </p>
                <h3>The Team</h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned before, the team contained 2 programmers, me included. Next to that, there were also 2 artists involved and one game designer,
                    who also helped with both programming and the creation of art assets. We also had the pleasure of working with a composer student which delivered
                    custom music for the game.
                </p>

                <h3>Unreal Engine 5</h3>
                <p>
                    This was my first big project using Unreal Engine 5. As programmers, the game was fully made using C++, no to very
                    little blueprints were used. It thought me a great deal, I was already quite proficient with modern C++ and working
                    with the standard, which made it easy but still quite tricky to transfer to C++ in UE5. Unreal's lack of documentation
                    didn't help transitioning either, I learned new things every day working on this project, and I can now say that I am
                    somewhat comfortable writing UE5 C++.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was my <b>first big project</b> using <b>Unreal Engine 5</b>. As programmers, the game was built entirely in <b>C++</b>,
                    with little to no use of Blueprints. It taught me a great deal. I was already quite proficient with modern C++ and
                    familiar with the standard library, which made the transition to C++ in UE5 easier but still <b>challenging</b>.
                    Unreal's limited documentation didn't make the transition any smoother. However, I learned <b>new things every day</b>
                    while working on this project, and I can now confidently say that I am <b>comfortable</b> writing C++ in Unreal Engine 5.

                                The distortion fields indicate that there is a hidden text there. A prompt shows

                                the field, the hidden text reveals itself.
