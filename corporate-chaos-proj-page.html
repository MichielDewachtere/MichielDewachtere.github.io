                        However, as you and some of your friends quickly become bored, you decide that racing on engine-driven office chairs
                        around the bustling environment would be a more enjoyable and productive activity than working alongside your less
                        entertaining colleagues. Chaos is bound to ensue.

                <h2>About the project</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Corporate chaos is a couch co-op racing game made in Unity. It was made with a team of 5, containing 3 artists and 2 programmers.
                    The game was made in the course of 12 weeks during my time at DAE. During this course we learned the <b>full production pipeline of a small indie game</b>.
                    We used various tools during this process, such as <b>Perforce</b> for version control and <b>HacknPlan</b> for planning. The pipeline consisted out of 3 stages,
                    We first had 3 weeks of brainstorming and <b>prototype</b>, followed by 6 weeks of <b>production</b>, made out of 2 production sprints. We ended with 2 weeks of <b>polishing</b>.
                    During 1 week, we had to spend around 10 hours on the project, 4 hours were spent in an office like environment, where the whole team sat and worked together.
                    <br><br>
                    The game features various pickups and environmental obstacles. A minimap is also present. Accelerating is time based, when accelerating on different
                    areas of the bar, the player is either boosted or slowed down.
                    <br><br>
                    Each game lasts for 3 laps. Their position and current lap is displayed in the HUD. Players can choose their color in the starting menu.
                </p>
                <h3>My Contribution</h3>
                <p>
                    We were only with 2 programmers. So the work was pretty spread out over different aspects of the game.
                    <br>
                    I implemented almost all the <b>pickups</b> and <b>obstacles</b>. The <b>camera</b> was also my work, we iterated over many different camera angles and systems. Level loading and different menus,
                    along with the HUD are also my work.
                </p>
                <h3>Team Work</h3>
                <p>
                    Of course teamwork was a big element in this project. Communicating, not only with my fellow programmer but also with the artists was key. I had the pleasure
                    of working with some very talented people.

                <h3>Unity</h3>
                <p>
                    As previously mentioned, this project was made using <b>Unity</b> and programmed in <b>C#</b>, here I learned most of what I know about the language. Choosing for Unity
                    was a fairly easy decision, the art style we chose didn't need the realism provided by Unreal Engine, and personally, C++ was our main programming language for
                    some time now, it was interesting to learn something new. We explored a fair bit of the engine, but there are still some things we haven't touched, and features
                    I have yet to discover.

                                As you can see more clearly here, the camera angle is slightly upwards behind the player, giving him a clear
                                overview of the track. You can also see the acceleration bar, displayed under the player.
