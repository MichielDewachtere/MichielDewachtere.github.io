            <p class="info-text">
                Corporate Chaos is a couch PVP-style racing game where you assume the role of an employee in a new start-up company.
                However, as you and some of your friends quickly become bored, you decide that racing on engine-driven office chairs
                around the bustling environment would be a more enjoyable and productive activity than working alongside your less
                entertaining colleagues. Chaos is bound to ensue.

            <h2>About Corporate Chaos</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        Corporate chaos is a couch co-op racing game made in Unity. It was made with a team of 5, containing 3 artists and 2 programmers.
                        The game was made in the course of 12 weeks during my time at DAE. During this course we learned the <b>full production pipeline of a small indie game</b>.
                        We used various tools during this process, such as <b>Perforce</b> for version control and <b>HacknPlan</b> for planning. The pipeline consisted out of 3 stages,
                        We first had 3 weeks of brainstorming and <b>prototype</b>, followed by 6 weeks of <b>production</b>, made out of 2 production sprints. We ended with 2 weeks of <b>polishing</b>.
                        During 1 week, we had to spend around 10 hours on the project, 4 hours were spent in an office like environment, where the whole team sat and worked together.
                        <br><br>
                        The game features various pickups and environmental obstacles. A minimap is also present. Accelerating is time based, when accelerating on different
                        areas of the bar, the player is either boosted or slowed down.
                        <br><br>
                        Each game lasts for 3 laps. Their position and current lap is displayed in the HUD. Players can choose their color in the starting menu.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>My Contribution</h3>
                    <p>
                        We were only with 2 programmers. So the work was pretty spread out over different aspects of the game.
                        <br>
                        I implemented almost all the <b>pickups</b> and <b>obstacles</b>. The <b>camera</b> was also my work, we iterated over many different camera angles and systems. Level loading and different menus,
                        along with the HUD are also my work.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Team Work</h3>
                    <p>
                        Of course teamwork was a big element in this project. Communicating, not only with my fellow programmer but also with the artists was key. I had the pleasure
                        of working with some very talented people.

                    <h3>Unity</h3>
                    <p>
                        As previously mentioned, this project was made using <b>Unity</b> and programmed in <b>C#</b>, here I learned most of what I know about the language. Choosing for Unity
                        was a fairly easy decision, the art style we chose didnt need the realism provided by Unreal Engine, and personally, C++ was our main programming language for
                        some time now, it was interesting to learn something new. We explored a fair bit of the engine, but there are still some things we haven't touched, and features
                        I have yet to discover.

                            As you can see more clearly here, the camera angle is slightly upwards behind the player, giving him a clear
                            overview of the track. You can also see the acceleration bar, displayed under the player.
